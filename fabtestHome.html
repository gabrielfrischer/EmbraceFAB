After demonstrating the test Item, place the Airex® pads In front of the person If standing In a corner.
Adopt a close supervisory position and hold watch at a height that allows for simultaneous monitoring
of the participant's arm position and eyes as well as the time. Instruct the participant to open the eyes
if she/he feels so unsteady that a loss of balance is imminent. Manually assist the client off the foam

        <li><b>testing procedure: </b> Following a demonstration of the task, instruct the participant to step up onto
the foam pads without assistance, position the feet shoulder width apart, fold the arms across the
chest, and close the eyes when ready. Begin timing as soon as the eyes close. Stop the trial if the
participant (a) opens the eyes before the timing period has elapsed, (b) lifts the arms off the chest, or
(c) loses balance and requires manual assistance to prevent falling. Instruct the participant to step
forward off the foam at the completion of the test item. Provide manual assistance if needed. </li>

performing a two-footed jump (i.e., leave the floor with two feet and land on two feet). Demonstrate
the correct movement prior to the participant performing the jump. Use the ruler to measure the
length of the foot and then multiply by two to determine the ideal distance to be jumped. Observe
whether the participant leaves the floor with both feet and lands with both feet. Position the ruler on
the floor and on the opposite side of the participant and close to the wall so that you can glance down

</li>
        <li><b>equipment required: </b>Metronome set at 100 beats per minute </li>
        <li><b>safety procedure: </b>Position yourself directly behind the participant during the standing portion of
the test Item so you can clearly see how far the head turns in either direction. Move to a position that
Is behind and slightly to the side of the participant during the walking portion of this test Item. Stand
close enough that you can provide manual assistance If the participant becomes unstable while
walking. </li>
        <li><b>testing procedure: </b> After first demonstrating the test item, ask the participant to practice turning the
head in time with the metronome while standing in place. Watch to see that the participant Is turning
the head the required distance to both sides and at the required speed. Provide verbal cueing If the
participant Is not performing the head turns correctly. Once the participant appears to have the
correct head turning rhythm (after no more than 4 to 6 head turns), Instruct him/her to begin walking
forward. The head turns should be to the beat of the metranome. Begin counting steps as soon as
the participant begins to walk forward with head turns. Observe whether the participant deviates from
a straight path while walking or is unable to turn the head the required distance (In one or both
directions) and/or at the required speed. If the participant Is unable to achieve the correct head
turning rhythm while standing It Is highly unlikely he/she will be able to achieve It while walking
(making the scoring of the test item a little easier). Also, In most cases, the steps will be
synchronized with the head turns, making the counting of 10 steps easier. </li>
